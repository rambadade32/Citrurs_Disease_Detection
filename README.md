# Citrurs_Disease_Detection
Detection a Disease of Citrus tree is done using a pre-trained Convolution Neural Network with tensorflow and keras API
## Goal:-
  The main aim of This Project is to Classify The infected Images in to their Particular Disease category and provide the respected measure suggested by experties to that User.

## Data:-


## Preproccing



## Training
We've Designed Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks and selected Three Nets
* Mobile Net,Efficient Net,Nas Net and got a better accuracy on Mobilenet.
* ***Best Model***:-
>* Citrus-leaves-disease classifier whose architecture is same as MobileNetV3 
>* This was already trained of Cassava leaf's for 6 classes, Link to this model is here [Tensorflow](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_resnet_v2/classification/5)
>* We had five classes so trained this model by adding own fully connected layer.
>* Trained model is uploded [here](https://github.com/AdiShirsath/Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Detection/tree/main/Model)
